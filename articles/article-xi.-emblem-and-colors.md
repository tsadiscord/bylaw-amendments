# Article XI. Emblem and Colors

### SECTION 1

The TSA emblem is a rectangular shape with three parts. The middle \#\# SECTION and largest part of the emblem contains the letters TSA in a very large, bold print. The letters are white on a blue background. Below these letters and about 1/3 the size, is the name of the association–Technology Student Association–in white letters on a red background. The top portion of the emblem is a blank, red, rectangular shape, the same size as the bottom area. This portion is intentionally left blank so that each state can put its own name on the emblem if desired.
