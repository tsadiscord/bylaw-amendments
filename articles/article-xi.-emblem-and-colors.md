# Article XI. Emblem and Colors

### SECTION 1

The TSA emblem is a rectangular shape with three parts. The middle section and largest part of the emblem contains the letters TSA in a very large, bold print. The letters are white on a blue background. Below these letters and about 1/3 the size, is the name of the association–Technology Student Association–in white letters on a red background. The top portion of the emblem is a blank, red, rectangular shape, the same size as the bottom area. This portion is intentionally left blank so that each state can put its own name on the emblem if desired.

### SECTION 2

The colors of TSA shall be scarlet \(red\), white, and blue \(navy\). Scarlet \(red\) represents the strength and determination of the technology education students and teachers to obtain their goal. White represents high standards, morals, and religious beliefs. Blue \(navy\) represents the sincerity of the technology education students and teachers in obtaining a greater knowledge of our technological world.
