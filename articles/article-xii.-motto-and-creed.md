* Guided by my teachers, artisans from industry, and my own initiative, I will strive to do my best in making my school, community, state, and nation better places in which to live.
* I will accept the responsibilities that are mine. I will accept the theories that are supported by proper evidence. I will explore on my own for safer, more effective methods of working and living.

* I will make it my goal to do better each day the task before me, and to be steadfast in my belief in my God, and my fellow Americans.
